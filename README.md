#Park It! - Private

Park It! is a dog park app that allows you to search for local parks in your area, and allows you to check in and out of the park. The intention is so that you can keep track of dogs that your dogs get along with, receive a notification whenever those dogs check in at the park, and be warned when "disliked" dogs are there.

This specific app is exclusive to my local community, as it's a prototype - think of it as closed beta testing. Park It! - Private currently uses Firebase for user auth and Firestore for the database. The public version will use an SQL database for scalability purposes. Firestore might've been a poor decision, but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. More exposure to other tech, and I get to practice refactoring.

### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
