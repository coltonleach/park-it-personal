            Added auto checkout feature. Every 5 minutes, the server will check
            who's currently checked in. If any user is checked in for longer
            than 30 minutes, they will automatically be checked out.

            When you get automatically checked out, the banner saying "you're
            currently checked in" will still be visible. If you refresh your
